        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <h4>What is the competition doing right?</h4>
        <p>Competitiors often display their work with high-quality images or protoypes. Portfolios are typically well
            organized and use clean and profession design. Websites use cohesive branding that reflect their personal
            style.</p>
        <h4>What is the competition doing wrong?</h4>
        <p>Some site have cluttered layouts or they overly animate their site that can distract for the content. Some
            portfolios contain generic content, making the portfolio blend in with others in the industry. Some
            portfolios showcase unfinished work or they lack description of their projects, or their role in a
            collaborative project.</p>
        <h4>How can I do better?</h4>
        <p>I can do better by focusing on my strenths to create a unique brand identity. I should tell a story with case
            study that outline my process, challenges, and results for my projects. I need to show off the impact of my
            work. I could also include interative elements to make my website engaging.</p>
